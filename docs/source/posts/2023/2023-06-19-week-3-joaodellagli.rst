Hello everyone, it's time for another weekly blogpost! This week,
I will talk about how you should watch your expectations when working with any project.

This Last Week's Effort
-----------------------
As I supposedly managed to make the texture allocation part working, this last week's goal was to render something to a FBO. Well, I could make
textures work, but what I wasn't expecting and later realised, was that the FBO setup not working. Below I will describe where I got stuck.

Where the Problem Was
---------------------
After getting the textures setup right, I was ready to render some color to the FBO. Well, I **was**, because I didn't expect
I would have another problem, this time, with the FBO setup. As described in my :doc:`week 1 blogpost <2023-06-05-week-1-joaodellagli>`,
a FBO needs some requirements to work. My current problem relies on the FBO method ``FBO.SetContext()``, that for some reason is not being able to generate the FBO.
Below, how the method is currently operating:

Apparently, the method is stuck before the ``this->CreateFBO()``, that can be checked when we call ``FBO.GetFBOIndex()``, that returns a ``0`` value,
meaning the FBO was not generated by the ``glGenFramebuffers()`` function, that is inside the ``GetContext()`` method.

This Week's Goals
-----------------
As I got stuck again with this simple step, talking with my mentors we concluded that a plan B is needed for my GSoC participation as
my current project is not having much progress. This plan B that I am gonna start working on this week involves working on `FURY Speed <https://github.com/fury-gl/furyspeed>`_,
a FURY addon that aims to develop optimized functions and algorithms to help speed up graphical applications. The suggestion was to
work on a PR I submitted months ago, `#783 <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/783>`_, in a way to integrate that into FURY Speed.
Also, I plan to keep working on my current project to find the solution I will need to make the FBO usage work.

Let's get to work!
