What did you do this week?
--------------------------
Due to ongoing exams, my productivity was limited this week. However, I managed to find some time to explore and review a few PRs submitted by contributors:

1. Ellipsoid PR `#791 <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791>`_:
   This PR focuses on creating a new ellipsoid actor defined with SDF and raymarching techniques.

2. Website Improvement PR `#812 <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/812>`_:
   This PR includes changes for the new compatibility section on the FURY home page.

Towards the end of the week, I had a meeting with my mentor. We discussed the current status of ongoing PRs and identified action points to focus on in the upcoming weeks. This discussion provided clarity on the challenges faced with certain PRs and issues.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------
Fortunately, I didn't encounter any major roadblocks or challenges that hindered my progress this week.

What is coming up next?
------------------------
With the action points provided by my mentor, I will be dedicating the next week to completing those tasks.
