GSoC 2023: Community Bonding Period
-----------------------------------

Hello All!

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be participating in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) for yet another year. To catch a glimpse of my previous journey, check out my experiences `here <https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/ganimtron_10s-blog/>`_.

During the community bonding period, we had our first GSoC meet, where we got acquainted with the program's rules and regulations. It was an excellent opportunity to virtually meet my fellow contributors and discuss our upcoming projects. Excitement filled the air as we exchanged ideas and set goals for the summer ahead.

Stay tuned for updates on my GSoC project as I share my progress, challenges, and breakthroughs along the way. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of this remarkable community.
