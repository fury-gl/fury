Hello everyone,
Welcome back to another update on my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 journey! This week, my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__ and I focused on refining the lazy loading feature and optimizing import statements within FURYâ€™s ``examples modules``.


Reviewing and Refining Lazy Loading
------------------------------------

This week was dedicated to a thorough review of the lazy loading implementation I introduced in the previous weeks. My mentor provided invaluable feedback, and together we identified areas where the implementation could be improved.


I addressed several issues, including
--------------------------------------

- **Error Fixes**: During the review, we identified some edge cases that were not handled correctly by the lazy loading mechanism. I corrected these errors to ensure the feature works seamlessly across the FURY codebase.

- **Import Simplification**: One significant change was simplifying how FURY is imported in example modules. Previously, the import statements were more complex, like ``from fury import ....`` To align with the lazy loading principles and reduce unnecessary overhead, I updated these statements to a more straightforward ``import fury`` This change ensures that only the necessary components are loaded when they are actually needed, improving performance.


Rebasing and Squashing
-----------------------

After making these adjustments, I proceeded with rebasing and squashing my commits. This process was essential to maintain a clean and organized commit history. Despite the challenges, I managed to resolve all conflicts, and my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__, approved the changes. The pull request was successfully merged, marking another milestone in the project.


Did I get stuck anywhere?
--------------------------

No, I did not encounter any major roadblocks this week. The tasks were challenging but manageable, and I was able to address them effectively with the guidance of my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__.

What's Next?
------------

In the upcoming week,

- I will continue addressing Sphinx warnings related.
- start working to improve de FURY website.

Thank you for following along, and stay tuned for more updates as I continue to make progress on this project!
