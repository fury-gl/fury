Hello everyone,
Welcome back to another update on my GSoC 2024 journey. This week, my focus was primarily on addressing Sphinx warnings caused by typos in blog posts.


Addressing Sphinx Warnings
--------------------------

This week, I dedicated my time to resolving Sphinx warnings that were popping up due to typos in various blog posts. Out of the 100 warnings that were initially present, I was able to fix 98 of them. This process involved carefully reviewing the documentation, identifying the sources of the warnings, and making the necessary corrections.

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of some of the warnings I addressed:

Did I get stuck anywhere ?
--------------------------

While most of the warnings were straightforward to fix, a few required a bit more time and attention to detail. In particular, some typos were present in code snippets, which required careful examination to ensure that the corrections did not introduce any errors.

What's Next ?
--------------

In the upcoming week,

- I will begin addressing Sphinx warnings related to typos in the documentation for certain modules.
- I will also focus on improving the overall readability and clarity of the documentation to enhance the user experience.
- Refining Lazy Loading Implementation according to the feedback received from my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`_.
