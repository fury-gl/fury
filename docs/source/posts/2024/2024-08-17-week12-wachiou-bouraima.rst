Helloüëãüèæ
I'm `Wachiou BOURAIMA <https://github.com/WassCodeur>`__,
All good things must come to an end, and it's with a mixture of satisfaction and nostalgia that I end this final week of my GSoC 2024 mission.  It's been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to share the progress I've made in my final week.


Addressing Sphinx Warnings
--------------------------

In my final week, I focused on addressing the remaining Sphinx warnings related to the documentation. The primary challenge was understanding and resolving issues that arose from the documentation format.
The core issue stemmed from a conflict between the documentation conventions used. Specifically, the docstrings in our modules followed the ``numpydoc`` convention, while our ``conf.py`` file was set up for ``sphinx.ext.napoleon``. Since these two conventions have different structures and expectations, Sphinx struggled to compile the docstrings correctly, leading to numerous warnings.

Here's a snippet of the configuration in our ``conf.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
        ...
        "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
        "sphinx.ext.autosummary",
        "sphinx.ext.githubpages",
        "sphinx.ext.intersphinx",
        "sphinx.ext.napoleon",
        ...

        ]


To address this:
----------------

1- Identified the Problem:

- Discovered that the mismatch between the ``numpydoc`` style and the ``napoleon`` extension caused Sphinx to fail in parsing and generating documentation properly.

2- Explored Solutions:

- I reviewed the documentation styles and configurations to understand the differences between ``numpydoc`` and ``napoleon``.
- Evaluated whether to convert the docstrings to match the ``napoleon`` style or update the configuration to align with ``numpydoc``.

3- Decided on a Path Forward:

- After careful consideration, I chose to update the configuration to support the ``numpydoc`` style, as it was more consistent with our existing docstrings.
- By making this change, I was able to resolve the conflicts and successfully compile the documentation without warnings.

Here's a snippet of the updated configuration in our ``conf.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
            ...
            "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
            "numppydoc",
            "sphinx.ext.autosummary",
            "sphinx.ext.githubpages",
            "sphinx.ext.intersphinx",
            ...
    ]


Did I get stuck?
-----------------

No, I didn't get stuck. I was able to solve the problems by carefully analyzing them and choosing the most appropriate solution with the help of my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__. This experience further enhanced my troubleshooting skills and deepened my understanding of documentation conventions.


Acknowledgements

Looking Ahead
-------------

As `GSoC 2024` comes to an end, I'm filled with gratitude for this incredible learning experience. While my official time in `GSoC` is concluding, my journey with open source and ``FURY`` is far from over. I look forward to continuing to contribute and grow alongside the ``FURY`` community.
Thank you for following along with my `GSoC` journey.
