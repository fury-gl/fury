Hey !
This week, More Shaders!

What did you do this week?
--------------------------
The task assigned for this week was to explore more shader techniques which could be implemented using FURY and which would demonstrate the capability of FURY shader system. So i decided to work on implementing shading examples such as Gooch shading and reflection shader using textures.


Below are the outputs of the techniques i worked on :
