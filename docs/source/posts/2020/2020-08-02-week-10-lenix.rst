Hey !
This week, More Shaders!

What did you do this week?
--------------------------
After merging the SDF actor last week , the mentors and I decided to work on another project idea which was discussed prior to GSoC . So the next step assigned to me was to look into the current shader framework and create immersive visualizations using shaders. Being interested in volumetric rendering I looked into volumetric cloud rendering algorithms and created a basic shader-based render in FURY.


The output for the same is given below:

The shader demos are available `here <https://github.com/lenixlobo/fury/tree/shader-demos>`_

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------
The main focus now is to discuss and work on shader demos which an demonstrate the capabilities of FURY

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------
No issues were faced this week
