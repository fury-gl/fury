Make sure to check out Project `FURY <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury>`_

Hey Everyone!
Today marked the official end of the coding period for Google Summer of Code 2020. On this day I would like to take the opportunity to thank all my mentors and Soham who have shown immense support during this time and helped me grow not only to be a better programmer but also to be a better team member. While the GSoC period ends, I will try my best to be active and contribute to the project and help it grow.
Cheers!

What did you do this week?
--------------------------
This being the final week of GSoC , my task was to create a PR which showcases not only the shader capabilities of the project but also to create a example which integrates both the UI and shader system of project FURY. This example can help new users to get familiar with both the UI and shaders.
Apart from this i also worked on a Toon Shader.

The output for the above task is given below :

The shader demos are available `here <https://github.com/lenixlobo/fury/tree/shader-demos>`_

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------
The next week I will work on the final GSoC documentation which explains what I worked on throughout the GSoC period. In case of any changes are requested by the mentors I will also try to implement them.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------
With the help of Soham and the mentors this week went smoothly.
