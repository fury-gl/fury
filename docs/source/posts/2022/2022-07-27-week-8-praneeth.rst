What did you do this week?
--------------------------
This week I started working on the `polyline` feature. After a lot of investigating and trying out different things, I found a way to call the dragging event manually without any prior click event. VTK actually captures the mouse movement using the ``MouseMoveEvent``. This event is then modified by FURY to only be called after the click event. So I added a new callback to track the mouse movement and set the current canvas as an active prop because it is required to capture the drag event happening on it.

I had to look for some ways by which we could make the icons look smoother. For this, I created an icon test file, which consisted of a set of icons of varying scales. Then on these icons, I used some vtkTexture methods discussed in the meeting, such as ``MipmapOn`` and ``InterpolateOn``. You can see some differences in the icons below:

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------
It took some time to get settled with all the things as my college reopened.
I was trying to use shaders with the UI elements to implement the freehand drawing, but then my mentors suggested that I should look  into the tracer widget in the VTK.

What is coming up next?
-----------------------
Updating PR `#623`_ to keep `rotation_slider` on the top of the screen.
Looking into various vtk tracer widgets to see if we can use that to create freehand drawings.
