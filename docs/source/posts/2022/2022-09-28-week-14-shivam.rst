What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- This week, I started with multiple actor support in skinning and managed to do it
  successfully. Here's the preview using the BrainStem model.

- Implementing multiple animation channels support (as seen in the ``Fox`` model). The ``get_skin_timelines()`` method now returns a dictionary of all animation channels with Timeline as their value.

- We merged two PRs, `#689`_ (colors from Material) and `#643`_ (simple animations).

- Added ability to load morphing information and create timelines from it. Here's a preview of the ``AnimatedMorphCube`` and ``AnimatedMorphSphere`` models:
