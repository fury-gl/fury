What did you do this week?
--------------------------
- I started this week by fixing the segmentation fault for the skinning test. I could not fix this as of now.

- I imported the ``RiggedFigure`` model into the Blender and I was quite impressed with how it visualizes each bone. So, I created a function that creates an arrow actor in place of a bone, and by applying the correct transformation, we get the bones of a model in place. Here's a quick preview of bones in Blender vs bones in FURY:

- After having the bones actor, I noticed that some bones are not aligned correctly. It was happening due to multiplication of the same transformation matrix twice.

- I also created a function that calculates the total transformation of a node, it eliminates the need to use ``timeline.get_value`` in ``get_skin_timeline`` function.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- It seems like I fixed everything, but we are not getting the correct model at timestamp 0. We need to find the cause and fix it!

- Cleaning the Simple Animation PR `#643`_, and merging it.


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

- While applying the timeline, we were getting the identity matrix for timestamp 0.0s, it was set to a new value before. We figured this in our meeting that it's happening due to some model's animation not starting from 0.0s.
