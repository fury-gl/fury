What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- Fixed some issues in the hierarchical order animation support `PR`_ that we discussed during last week's meeting (mostly naming issues).

- Explained the introductory tutorial a little. But it is not suitable for beginners. So, I will spend time improving tutorials this week.

- Added extrusion to `vector_text`_ to allow the z-scaling to be functional.

- Fixed ``lightColor0`` being `hard-set`_ to ``(1, 1, 1)``. Instead, it's now using the ``Scene`` to set the lighting uniforms.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------


- Improve tutorials.

- Find out how to get the ``Scene`` from the actor instead of manually assigning it.

- If I have time, I will try to implement recording animation as GIF or as a video.


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

I didn't get stuck this week.
