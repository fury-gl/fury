What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- Made two tutorials in this `PR`_ that show two approaches on how to animate primitives of the same FURY actor using the ``Timeline``.

- Tried sending all keyframes at once as uniforms, but I faced a performance issue doing this.

- Set uniforms that are not being sent by VTK for the billboard actor.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Alter the ``Timeline`` to use matrices instead of setting values directly to allow hierarchical transformation.

- Improve the API of the ``PartialActor`` to act almost like a normal actor.


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

I had some issues trying to get shaderâ€™s uniforms to hold their data, and solving this issue led to another issue, which was a performance issue.
