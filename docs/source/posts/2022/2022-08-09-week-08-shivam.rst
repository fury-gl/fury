What did you do this week?
--------------------------

This week I had to fix the transformation issue in glTF animation. As discussed in the last meeting, I disabled vertex transformation and applied the transformation after the actor was formed.

- Creating transformation matrix using the TRS data from nodes.
- Extract Translation, Rotation, and Scale matrices from the transformation matrix.

I also started investigating more on the skinning animation.

- I created functions to extract and apply the ``InvertBindMatrices`` to the vertices.
- Also, applying the ``globalTransformMatrices`` to the mesh.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Skeletal animations support


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

- Even after applying the transformation to the actor, after it's created. Some models did not behave as intended. We still need to figure this issue out and fix it.
