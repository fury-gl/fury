What did you do this week?
--------------------------
I started this week by creating a quick PR `#645 <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/645>`_ for the UI sliders. The sliders raised ``ZeroDivsionError`` when the min and max values were the same. To solve this, I handled the case where the value_range becomes zero and then manually set the handle position to zero.

Then I updated the implementation of the Grouping Shapes feature to support the translation and rotation of the shapes grouped together, as you can see below.

After this, I worked on the `PolyLine` and removed the extra point being added to the start of the `PolyLine` whenever a new instance was created.
