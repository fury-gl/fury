What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- This week I had the first working `example`_ of skeletal animation ready. I was able to render the `SimpleSkin`_ model. Here's a quick preview:

        <iframe id="player" type="text/html"   width="600" height="390" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74976752/184981715-a83a8a36-f2bf-4ff1-9366-0c302dcf3f9b.mp4" frameborder="0"></iframe>

- I wrote a custom `interpolator`_ (just like the tangent cubic spline interpolator) for interpolating two transformation matrices.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Generalising the skinning code to work with other models as well (it supports only the ``SimpleSkin`` model as of now).
- Creating a custom interpolator to interpolate more than 4 matrices at once.


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

No, I didn't get stuck this week.
