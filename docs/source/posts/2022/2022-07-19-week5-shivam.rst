What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- Finalised the glTF export PR `#630`_., adding tutorial, docs, and tests for all functions.
- Added support for exporting lines and dot actors.
- ``primitive.modes`` is now set if the rendering mode is a line, dot, or triangle.
- Working on importing different primitive modes, the current glTF importer can render only triangles.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

This week I'll be working on the following:

- Get the PR `#630`_. merged by this week.
- Loading the animations (simple, morph, and skeletal) data as dictionaries from the glTF model so that it can be sent to the timeline.
- Try different examples on Mohamed's PR (`#626`_.) and try running glTF animations if time permits.


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

- There wasn't any model in the Khronos glTF samples repository that uses the ``LINE`` or ``POINT`` modes. So I had to rely on the models that I exported using the glTF exporter.
