What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- Improved the API of a `PartialActor`_ by adding some methods to control the scales, positions and colors.

- Added a new example of using the new hierarchical feature to animate an arm robot.

- Improved `vector_text`_ a little by adding options to control its direction.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Finish the hierarchical order animation support `PR`_.

- Explain tutorials in more detail. See this `issue`_.

- Fix issues discovered by Serge in this `review`_.

- Fix ``lightColor0`` being `hard-set`_ to ``(1, 1, 1)``. Instead, find a way to get this property the same way other polygon-based actor gets it.

- Try to get PRs and issues mentioned above merged, closed or ready for a final review.
