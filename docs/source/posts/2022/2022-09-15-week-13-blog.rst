What did you do this week?
--------------------------

This week I fixed all the issues with skeletal animations, and we got to see our first render of skeletal animation :).

- Implemented a hierarchical timeline system (i.e., one timeline for each bone, and the timeline will contain its parent timeline in a hierarchy).

- I figured out that we don't need to apply the parent transform as we're applying it to the vertex data while forming the actor. So the skin matrix becomes
``SkinMatrix = InverseBindPose * BoneDeform`` where ``BoneDeform = CurrentBoneTransform * ParentBonetransform``.

Here's a preview using the ``CesiumMan`` model:

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

- No, I didn't get stuck this week.
