Welcome to the ninth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the eighth week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------

#. Updated `PR #452`_: Had an extra meeting with the mentors in which we fine-tuned the `molecular module and optimised the code to make it more pythonic.

#. I was able to generate vertices and triangles for Solvent Excluded Surfaces (SES) by using a bioconda package called `msms`_. It's based on `this paper`_ by Michel F. Sanner, Arthur J. Olson & Jean-Claude Spehner. The vertices and triangles were then sent to surface actor to generate a surface.

	    SES surface generated via msms and surface actor

#. Added my GSoC blogs to the FURY blogs directory. (`PR #475`_)

Other goals will be decided in the meeting with mentors.

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

#. Research about recent papers having good (fast) algorithms to create the molecular surfaces.
#. Create tutorials to explain how to use molecular module.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

No.
