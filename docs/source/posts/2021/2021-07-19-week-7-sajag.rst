Welcome to the seventh weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the sixth week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------

#. Updated `Molecular module`_: made it more pythonic, implemented
   ribbon actor, added support to pass numpy arrays (earlier, atomic
   data could only be added by using the add_atom).
#. Created `PR #462`_ to:

   -  Update the helical motion animation to use a single line actor,
      added textblocks to display velocity of the particle.

   -  For brownian motion animation, I removed rotation(azimuth) and box
      actor, added textblock to display the number of particles and to
      show the simulation steps.

#. Updated surface animation (used gridUI, added multiple animations).

   |image3|

#. Created a `topic`_ on vtk discourse forum to query about gaps in
   bonds (tried resolving it by manipulating vtkProperties:
   BackfaceCulling, FrontfaceCulling but was unsuccessful).
#. Read about molecular surface (theory behind it).

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

#. Update molecular module by adding tests, ribbon actor.
#. Try to implement molecular surface representation.
#. Interactivity of the molecules.

Did you get stuck anywhere?

I didn't get stuck anywhere this week.
