What did I do this week?
------------------------
Below are the tasks that I worked on:

* `Added Horizontal/Vertical Layout to the layout module <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/480>`_ : These PRs add support for Horizontal/Vertical layouts. These layouts allow the actors to be placed in a horizontal/vertical stack.

* `Finalizing Card2D UI element <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/398>`_ : As panel border, wrap overflow PRs were merged this week I updated the Card2D UI to take advantage of these features.
* `Added GSoC blog posts <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/477>`_ : Added GSoC blog posts in .rst format for the FURY's blog website. Also reviewed the blog posts of other members.
* `Added support for dragging by label text/icon in Tree2D UI <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/460>`_ : Added support for dragging TreeNode2D by the label text/icon. This will help making the Tree2D as well as TreeNode2D UIs more mobile.

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------
For now I am not stuck anywhere but I have yet to start my work on freetype this could pose some trouble.

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------
Next week I will finish the remaining UI elements which includes Accordion2D, SpinBox2D.

**See you guys next week!**
