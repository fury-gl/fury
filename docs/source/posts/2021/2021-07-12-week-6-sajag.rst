Welcome to the sixth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the fifth week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------

1. Generalised the vtkProteinRibbonFilter implementation.
2. Updated the molecular module based on suggestions of team members
   and mentors (`PR #452`_).
3. Updated wave function animation (`PR #362`_).

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

1. Update molecular module based on team members' suggestions and add
   tests for the same.
2. Add protein ribbon implementation to the molecular module.
3. Begin working on molecular surface model.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

No! **I was finally able to generalise the vtkProteinRibbonFilter implementation!!** I'm
grateful to the mentors for keeping a meeting and for helping me debug
the code. I figured out most of the stuff courtesy the meeting.
