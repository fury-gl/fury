Welcome to the sixth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the fifth week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------

#. Generalised the vtkProteinRibbonFilter implementation.
#. Updated the `molecular module`_ based on suggestions of team members
   and mentors.
#. Updated wave function animation `PR`_.

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

#. Update molecular module based on team members' suggestions and add
   tests for the same.
#. Add protein ribbon implementation in the molecular.
#. Begin working on molecular surface model.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

No! **I was finally able to generalise the vtkProteinRibbonFilter implementation!!** I'm
grateful to the mentors for keeping a meeting and for helping me debug
the code. I figured out most of the stuff courtesy the meeting.
