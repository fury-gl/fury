Welcome to the fifth weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the fourth week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------

Created a `PR`_ for the molecular module. Enables the ability to create
three types of molecular representations:

#. Space-filling model aka calotte model and CPK model.
#. Stick model.
#. Ball and Stick model.

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

Mentors suggested changes to be made to the molecular module which I
shall make. Other goals to be decided post mid-week meeting.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

Sending protein data to ProteinRibbonFilter via a vtkPolyData has been
unsuccessful so far.

.. _PR: https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/452

``Au Revoir!``
