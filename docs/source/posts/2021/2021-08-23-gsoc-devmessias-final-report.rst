Abstract
--------

We have changed some points of my project in the first meeting.
Specifically, we focused the efforts into developing a streaming system
using the WebRTC protocol that could be used in more generic scenarios
than just the network visualization. In addition to that, we have opted
to develop the network visualization for fury as a separated repository
and package available `here <https://github.com/fury-gl/helios>`__. The
name Helios was selected for this new network visualization system based
on the Fury rendering pipeline.

Proposed Objectives
-------------------

-  Create a streaming system (stadia-like) for FURY

   -  Should work in a low-bandwidth scenario
   -  Should allow user interactions and collaboration across the
      Internet using a web-browser

-  Helios Network System objectives:

   -  Implement the Force-Directed Algorithm with examples
   -  Implement the ForceAtlas2 algorithm using cugraph with examples
   -  Implement Minimum-Distortion Embeddings algorithm (PyMDE) and
      examples
   -  Non-blocking network algorithms computation avoiding the GIL using
      the Shared Memory approach
   -  Create the documentation and the actions for the CI

-  Stretch Goals:

   -  Create an actor in FURY to draw text efficiently using shaders
   -  Add support to draw millions of nodes using FURY
   -  Add support to control the opengl state on FURY

Objectives Completed
--------------------

-  .. rubric:: Create a streaming system (stadia-like) for FURY
      :name: create-a-streaming-system-stadia-like-for-fury

   To construct the streaming system for my project we have opted to
   follow three main properties and behaviors:

   1. avoid blocking the code execution in the main thread (where the
      vtk/fury instance resides)
   2. work inside of a low bandwidth environment
   3. make it easy and cheap to share the rendering result. For example,
      using the free version of ``ngrok``

   To achieve the first property we need to circumvent the GIL and allow
   python code to execute in parallel. Using the threading module alone
   is not good enough to reach real parallelism as Python calls in the
   same process can not execute concurrently. In addition to that, to
   achieve better organization it is desirable to define the server
   system as an uncoupled module from the rendering pipeline. Therefore,
   I have chosen to employ the multiprocessing approach for that. The
   second and third property can be only achieved choosing a suitable
   protocol for transferring the rendered results to the client. We have
   opted to implement two streaming protocols: the MJPEG and the WebRTC.
   The latter is more suitable for low-bandwidth scenarios [1].

   The image below shows a simple representation of the streaming
   system.

   be easily integrated inside of a Jupyter notebook.

*Pull Requests:* \* https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/480

-  .. rubric:: 2D and 3D marker actor
      :name: d-and-3d-marker-actor

   This feature gave FURY the ability to efficiently draw millions of
   markers and impostor 3D spheres. This feature was essential for the
   development of Helios. This feature work with signed distance fields
   (SDFs) you can get more information about how SDFs works here [4] .

   The image below shows 1 million of markers rendered using an Intel
   HD graphics 3000.

-  .. rubric:: Fine-Tunning the OpenGl State
      :name: fine-tunning-the-opengl-state

   Sometimes users may need to have finer control on how OpenGL will
   render the actors. This can be useful when they need to create
   specialized visualization effects or to improve the performance.

   In this PR I have worked in a feature that allows FURY to control the
   OpenGL context created by VTK

-  .. rubric:: Helios Network Visualization Lib: Network Layout
      Algorithms
      :name: helios-network-visualization-lib-network-layout-algorithms

   **Case 1:** Suppose that you need to monitor a hashtag and build a
   social graph. You want to interact with the graph and at the same
   time get insights about the structure of the user interactions. To
   get those insights you can perform a node embedding using any kind of
   network layout algorithm, such as force-directed or minimum
   distortion embeddings.

   **Case 2:** Suppose that you are modelling a network dynamic such as
   an epidemic spreading or a Kuramoto model. In some of those network
   dynamics a node can change the state and the edges related to the
   node must be deleted. For example, in an epidemic model a node can
   represent a person who died due to a disease. Consequently, the
   layout of the network must be recomputed to give better insights.

   In the described cases, if we want a better (UX) and at the same time
   a more practical and insightful application of Helios, the employed
   layout algorithms should not block any kind of computation in the
   main thread.

   In Helios we already have a lib written in C (with a python wrapper)
   which performs the force-directed layout algorithm using separated
   threads avoiding the GIL problem and consequently avoiding blocking
   the main thread. But what about the other open-source network layout
   libs available on the internet? Unfortunately, most of those libs
   have not been implemented like Helios force-directed methods and
   consequently, if we want to update the network layout the Python
   interpreter will block the computation and user interaction in your
   network visualization.

   My solution for having PyMDE and CuGraph-ForceAtlas not blocking the
   main thread was to break the network layout method into two different
   types of processes: A and B and communicate both process using the
   Shared Memory approach. You can more information about this PR
   through my following posts [2], [3].

The image below show an example that I made and is available at
https://github.com/fury-gl/helios/blob/main/docs/examples/viz_mde.py

-  .. rubric:: Helios Network Visualization Lib: Visual Aspects
      :name: helios-network-visualization-lib-visual-aspects

Iâ€™ve made several stuffs to give Helios a better visual aspects. One of
them was to give a smooth real-time network layout animations. Because
the layout computations happens into a different process that the
process responsible to render the network was necessary to record the
positions and communicate the state of layout between both process.

The GIF below shows how the network layout through IPC behaved before
these modification

below, you can see how after those modifications the visual aspect is
better.

-  .. rubric:: Helios Network Visualization Lib: CI and Documentation
      :name: helios-network-visualization-lib-ci-and-documentation

Because Helios was an project that begins in my GSoC project It was
necessary to create the documentation, hosting and more. Now we have a
online documentation available at https://heliosnetwork.io/ although the
documentation still need some improvements.

The Helios Logo which was developed by
Filipi Nascimento.
