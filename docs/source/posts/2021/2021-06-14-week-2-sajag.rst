Welcome to the second weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the first week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------
I implemented the space filling model for proteins and created a PR for the same. Preview:

   (protein rendered: `3pgk <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3pgk>`_)
   
The PR has: 

1. Actor for space_filling_model.

2. Two examples where I show how to visualize the proteins:

   a. In `example 1 <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/439/files#diff-2c9d065c4d4873b6ce534137cfd990cea495faffd249ff35cf51e36749883534>`_, I parse a PDBx file myself and extract the atomic info essential for constructing the model which is then used by the actor to visualize it.
   
   b. In `example 2 <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/439/files#diff-68e69b9f24731ed981cd91763f3dd078aa2bf9a4da638d561352a9cf37cfd29c>`_, I parse a PDB file by using `Biopython module <http://biopython.org/>`_ and extract the atomic info essential for constructing the model which is then used by the actor to visualize it.

I created a basic test for the actor which needs to be improved. I'll discuss how to improve the test with the mentors.

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------
I have two major goals for the next week:

1. Make an actor for the space filling model of the proteins and make PR for the same which will also include the unit tests and a small tutorial for the users.
2. Try to understand the documentation of vtkProteinRibbonFilter which will prove beneficial in generating Ribbon diagrams.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------
I tried to create a class in python which inherits from a vtk class called vtkMoleculeReaderBase but was unsucessful in this endeavour. I'll try to find a workaround.

``Au Revoir!``
