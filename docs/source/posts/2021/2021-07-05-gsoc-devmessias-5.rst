What did you do this week?
--------------------------

`fury-gl/fury PR#437: WebRTC streaming system for FURY`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Before the `8c670c2`_ commit, for some versions of MacOs the
   streaming system was falling in a silent bug. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of
   time researching to found a cause for this. Fortunately, I could found
   the cause and the solution. This troublesome MacOs was falling in a
   silent bug because the SharedMemory Object was creating a memory
   resource with at least 4086 bytes indepedent if I've requested less
   than that. If we look into the MultiDimensionalBuffer Object
   (stream/tools.py) before the 8c670c2 commit we can see that Object
   has max_size parameter which needs to be updated if the SharedMemory
   was created with a "wrong" size.

`fury-gl/helios PR 1: Network Layout and SuperActors`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the past week I've made a lot of improvements in this PR, from
performance improvements to visual effects. Bellow are the list of the
tasks related with this PR:

-  - Code refactoring.
-  - Visual improvements: Using the UniformTools from my pull request
   `#424`_ now is possible to control all the visual characteristics at
   runtime.
-  - 2D Layout: Meanwhile 3d network representations are very usefully
   for exploring a dataset is hard to convice a group of network
   scientists to use a visualization system which dosen't allow 2d
   representations. Because of that I started to coding the 2d behavior
   in the network visualization system.
-  - Minimum Distortion Embeddings examples: I've created some examples
   which shows how integrate pymde (Python Minimum Distortion
   Embeddings) with fury/helios. The image below shows the result of
   this integration: a "perfect" graph embedding

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

I'll probably focus on the `heliosPR#1`_. Specifically, writing tests
and improving the minimum distortion embedding layout.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

I did not get stuck this week.
