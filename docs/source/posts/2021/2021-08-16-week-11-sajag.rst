Welcome to the eleventh weekly check-in. I'll be sharing my progress for the tenth week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------

#. Implemented `this paper`_ to generate Van der Waals surface and solvent-accessible surface (PR created: `PR #492`_). It was a good learning experience because the first time I read the paper, I didn't understand the underlying math, it all seemed alien to me. I had to read it many times, read about the algorithms used and understand the terminologies. I had a meeting with the mentors to understand a bit of the theory which proved to be quite fruitful as I understood how to go about making the space-filling model. `This`_ blog was helpful in understanding how to use vtkMarchingCubes with numpy arrays. One of the earliest SAS rendering looked like this (this implementation was not strictly according to the paper):

	    :width: 300
	    :height: 300
	    
	    Notice that it's rather rough

   Current implementation (this implementation was according to the paper):

	.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65067354/129560374-14180b22-14b2-449b-88a6-b3140226418d.png
	    :width: 300
	    :height: 300

	    grid dimenstions = 256 × 256 × 256, used smoothing algorithms recommended by vtk

I also understood how to go about rendering volumes. I think that the ability to render volumes with FURY will be a cool capability and I'll discuss my implementation and request the mentors for feedback and ideas in the weekly meeting. Example of volume rendering:

	    :width: 300
	    :height: 300

	    grid dimenstions = 256 × 256 × 256

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

I'll try to get `PR #452`_ merged. Documentation work to be done as GSoC coding period has come to an end.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

No.
