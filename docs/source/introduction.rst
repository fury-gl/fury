What is FURY?
-------------

It is a community-driven, open-source, and high-performance scientific visualization library that harnesses the graphics processing unit (GPU) for improved speed, precise interactivity, and visual clarity.

Statement of Need
-----------------

FURY was created to address the growing necessity of high-performance 3D scientific visualization in an easy-to-use API fully compatible with the Pythonic ecosystem. To achieve this FURY takes ideas from CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) and game engines to then be deployed for usage in everyday research practices.

Mission Statement
-----------------

The purpose of FURY is to make it easier to perform advanced visualizations and animations without compromising performance. We aim to build software that is:

* clearly written
* clearly explained
* a good fit for the underlying ideas
* a natural home for collaboration

We hope that, if we fail to do this, you will let us know and we will try and make it better.
