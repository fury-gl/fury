Overview
--------

Free Unified Rendering in pYthon is a Python package that provides a minimalistic but powerful API that enables advanced scientific visualization and 3D animations for scientific research.

FURY is a community-driven, open-source, and high-performance scientific visualization library that harnesses the graphics processing unit (GPU) for improved speed, precise interactivity, and visual clarity.

Statement of Need
-----------------

FURY was created to address the growing necessity of high-performance 3D scientific visualization in an easy-to-use API fully compatible with the Pythonic ecosystem. To achieve this FURY takes ideas from CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) and game engines to then be deployed for usage in everyday research practices.

Mission Statement
-----------------

The purpose of FURY is to make it easier to perform advanced visualizations and animations without compromising performance. We aim to build software that is:

* clearly written
* clearly explained
* a good fit for the underlying ideas
* a natural home for collaboration

We hope that, if we fail to do this, you will let us know and we will try and make it better. An easy way to access the FURY development team is either through our Discord live chat room or in GitHub.
